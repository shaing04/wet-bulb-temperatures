    <h2>California Wet-Bulb Temperatures</h2>
    <p>
      In 2025, California has an average Wet-Bulb Temperature of: XXX, but as
      time goes on, we can more and more of California turn darker as the
      average Wet-Bulb Temperature for the state increases over time. Currently,
      California is on track to hit XXX by the year 2050, and XXX by 2100, which
      may not seem like a lot but when we take into account that a dangerous
      level of Wet-Bulb Temperature is 30 degrees Celcius, where it simply gets
      too hot that the human body is unable to sweat enough to cool down,
      increasing risk of heat stroke, and other heat related afflictions.

        <strong>1. What have you done so far?</strong><br />So far, we have
        implemented visualizations for California, the United States, and the
        globe. Each of these visualizations includes interactive features,
        though they vary in complexity. For California and the US, users can
        interact through scrollytelling updates and tooltips that display
        Wet-Bulb temperature data when hovering over a county or state. The
        globe visualization is fully interactive, allowing users to click, drag,
        zoom, and explore temperature data worldwide. We have primarily focused
        on scrollytelling as the main mechanism for guiding users through the
        story of our data. The goal has been to create a narrative that is both
        informative and engaging, with interactions that enhance understanding.
        Currently, transitions between visualizations are basic, such as simple
        fade-ins and fade-outs. We are planning to refine these to make the
        experience more seamless and intuitive.

          >2. What will be the most challenging part of your project and design
          and why?</strong
        ><br />The most challenging part of our project to design is likely the
        overall website itself. We have ideas in mind for the layout, ordering
        of visualizations, and how users will navigate the page, but turning
        this vision into a cohesive design is difficult. Creating a balance
        between aesthetics, branding, and clarity of information is particularly
        challenging because we want the page to be both engaging and easy to
        understand. Currently, transitions are simple, and the page feels bare
        besides the visualizations. We hope to implement smoother transitions,
        such as zooming out from California to the US, and then out to the
        globe, to make navigation more fluid. Choosing the right color schemes
        and visual encodings is also difficult because it must accurately
        represent the data without overwhelming the user. Additionally, making
        the website responsive and functional across devices adds another layer
        of complexity. Overall, designing a cohesive, visually appealing, and
        informative experience will likely require the most effort.
