    <div class="text-box">
      Wet-bulb temperature is one of the simplest (and most important) metrics for
      understanding how heat affects the human body. Unlike the temperature you
      hear on the news, wet-bulb temperature captures both heat and humidity at
      the same time.
    </div>

    <div class="text-box">
      That matters because evaporation is the body’s main cooling mechanism. When
      we sweat, the moisture on our skin pulls heat away as it evaporates. But
      when the air is already saturated with humidity, sweat stops evaporating.
      The body can no longer cool itself, even in shade or with hydration.
    </div>

    <div class="text-box">
      Scientists warn that a sustained wet-bulb temperature of 35°C (95°F) is the
      upper limit of human survivability. Danger begins far earlier: at 28–31°C,
      people can suffer heat stroke, confusion, or cardiovascular strain.

            <p>
              In 1975, the global landscape of emissions looked very different.
              The United States and Western Europe remained among the highest emitters,
              even as the ongoing oil crisis slowed industrial growth. Despite this,
              the regions facing the hottest wet-bulb temperatures in the future are
              not the top emitters. Instead, countries like Bangladesh, India, and
              parts of Southeast Asia lead future extreme-temperature risk. These areas
              emitted relatively little in 1975, yet were projected to face the most
              dangerous heat-humidity levels. The imbalance between responsibility and
              vulnerability is already clear at this early point in the timeline.

            <p>
              By 1980, the oil crisis had ended, and global energy demand accelerated
              again. Fossil fuel use rebounded quickly, especially in rapidly
              industrializing economies. Yet the pattern remains: the nations emitting
              the most, such as the U.S., USSR, and Western Europe, are not the ones
              projected to experience the highest wet-bulb extremes in 2030. Instead,
              much hotter future temperatures will strike tropical, densely populated
              regions like India, Myanmar, and coastal West Africa. The gap between
              northern emitters and equatorial heat exposure continues to widen.

            <p>
              In 1990, emissions surged alongside globalization and expanding
              manufacturing. China’s rise was beginning, while the U.S. remained the
              single largest emitter. Yet future wet-bulb extremes in 2040 still
              cluster around South Asia, the Middle East, and equatorial Africa.
              Countries like Pakistan and the UAE, which were smaller emitters at the
              time, are projected to face some of the world's highest heat-humidity
              stress. Emissions and exposure continue to diverge.

            By 2005, China had overtaken the U.S. as the world’s largest emitter.
            Energy use was skyrocketing across Asia, while global transportation and
            industrial expansion drove emissions to record levels. Still, the hottest
            projected wet-bulb temperatures in 2055 remain concentrated in tropical
            climates. Heat-saturated regions are already close to physiological limits.
            High-emitting nations with cooler climates continue to shape the warming
            experienced elsewhere.

            <div class="us-card-line"></div>
            <p>
              In 2010, global emissions kept rising even as renewables began scaling.
              China, the U.S., and the EU dominated fossil fuel output. But the
              highest wet-bulb temperatures expected in 2060 concentrate in regions
              like South Asia and the Persian Gulf, areas already under severe heat
              strain. These regions contribute less carbon per capita, but face the
              harshest weather and temperature patterns.

          <div class="us-card">
            <div class="us-card-line"></div>
            <p>
              By 2020, brief dips in emissions caused by the pandemic gave way to a
              rapid rebound. Global totals remain near all-time highs. Meanwhile, the
              regions projected to have the most dangerous wet-bulb levels in 2070 are
              densely populated and vulnerable. Even today, Pakistan, India,
              Bangladesh, and the Gulf states see heat-humidity extremes more severe
              than high-emitting northern nations. The mismatch between who drives warming
              and who suffers from it remains clear.

    <p class="transition-text">
      our visualizations reveal an intriguing disparity: the countries driving the most carbon emissions are not always the ones projected to be facing the most extreme, life-threatening wet-bulb temperatures.
      Major emitters like the U.S. and China dominate the CO₂ bar chart, but our globe shows places like Southeast Asia, parts of Africa, the Middle East, and coastal regions around the world bearing some of the harshest heat stress.
      Places that contribute far less to global emissions are pushed closest to the limits of human survivability, while many of the biggest polluters are better resourced to adapt.
      By putting these two views side by side, our project highlights a core injustice of the climate crisis: those who warm the planet the most are not necessarily those who suffer or most severely from the heat.

          <strong>1. What have you done so far?</strong><br />So far, we have
          implemented visualizations for California, the United States, and the
          globe. Each of these visualizations includes interactive features,
          though they vary in complexity. For California and the US, users can
          interact through scrollytelling updates and tooltips that display
          Wet-Bulb temperature data when hovering over a county or state. The
          globe visualization is fully interactive, allowing users to click, drag,
          zoom, and explore temperature data worldwide. We have primarily focused
          on scrollytelling as the main mechanism for guiding users through the
          story of our data. The goal has been to create a narrative that is both
          informative and engaging, with interactions that enhance understanding.
          Currently, transitions between visualizations are basic, such as simple
          fade-ins and fade-outs. We are planning to refine these to make the
          experience more seamless and intuitive.
